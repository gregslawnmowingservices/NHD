    <h1>What Was The Comstock Act Of 1873?</h1>
</div>


<div>
    <p>Comstock Act, federal statute passed by the U.S. Congress in 1873 as an “Act of the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use.”</p>
    <p>Named for Anthony Comstock, a zealous crusader against what he considered to be obscenity, the act criminalized the use of any post office to send, among other things, any “obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile article, matter, thing, device, or substance” or any “article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use.” The law effectively prohibited the sending of any text or image then considered to be obscene or pornographic as well as any device or medication, or any information about such a device or medication, that could facilitate or result in abortion or contraception. Individuals convicted of violating the Comstock Act could receive up to five years of imprisonment with hard labor and a fine of up to $2,000.

Vestiges of the act endured as the law of the land into the late 20th century. In 1971 Congress removed the law’s provisions concerning contraception. Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade (1973), which recognized a constitutional right to abortion through the second trimester of pregnancy, the Comstock Act remained in force but was effectively dormant.

In 2000 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medication abortion by means of the drug mifepristone, which causes the lining of the uterus to deteriorate, in combination with misoprostol, which induces uterine contractions. From 2016 to 2021 the FDA adopted a series of measures to make mifepristone accessible to more patients. The combined changes extended the period during which the drug could be used from the first 7 to the first 10 weeks of pregnancy and effectively permitted the drug to be mailed to patients after a telehealth appointment with a nonphysician via a computer or mobile phone.</p>
