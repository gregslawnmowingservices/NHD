    <p>an 1873 anti-vice law banning the mailing of obscene matter and articles used to produce abortion â€“ could be used by a future presidential administration opposed to abortion rights to sharply restrict abortion nationwide. A literal interpretation of the Act could potentially also apply to materials used to produce all abortions, not just medication abortions; would not have exceptions; and could affect other medical care, such as miscarriage management.</p>
