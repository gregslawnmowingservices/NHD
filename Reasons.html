  <p>The Comstock Act of 1873 was primarily passed due to a moral panic surrounding the proliferation of "obscene" materials, including information about contraception, which led to Anthony Comstock, a prominent anti-vice crusader, lobbying Congress to ban the mailing of such materials through the postal system, effectively limiting access to reproductive health information and materials. 
 
Key points about the reasons behind the Comstock Act:
Moral concerns:
The Victorian era saw a strong emphasis on morality and social decorum, and many people were concerned about the spread of sexually explicit content, which they believed could corrupt society. 
 
Anthony Comstock's influence:
Comstock, leader of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, actively campaigned for legislation to restrict the distribution of "obscene" materials, including information about contraception and abortion. 
 
Broad definition of obscenity:
The Act's language was very broad, allowing for interpretation of "obscene" materials to include not just pornography but also any information related to birth control or abortion. 
 
Control over the mail system:
By utilizing the postal system as a means of enforcement, the Act aimed to limit the distribution of considered "obscene" materials nationwide.</p>
