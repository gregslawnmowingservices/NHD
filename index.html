            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The relationship between rights and responsibilities is at the heart of how societies function. Rights are the freedoms and privileges people are entitled to, like the right to vote or the right to free speech. Responsibilities, on the other hand, are duties or actions that people must take to ensure society runs smoothly, like following laws or voting in elections. Throughout history, different groups have fought for their rights, and societies have shaped the responsibilities of individuals and governments.</p>
            <p>This project explores how these ideas have changed over time, focusing on major events, movements, and historical figures that have helped shape our understanding of rights and responsibilities.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="overview">
            <h2>Historical Overview</h2>
            <p>Throughout history, different societies have defined rights and responsibilities in different ways. For example, in some early civilizations, only kings, priests, or landowners had the right to speak freely or make decisions for the community. As societies grew and evolved, people began to fight for equal rights, and governments started to recognize that everyone has certain rights that should be protected.</p>
            <p>Here are some key moments in history that helped shape the idea of rights and responsibilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Magna Carta (1215)</strong> – In 1215, King John of England was forced to sign the Magna Carta, a document that limited the king's powers and established that even the monarch was not above the law. This was an important step in recognizing the rights of individuals, especially the right to fair treatment under the law. It paved the way for the development of constitutional governments that would protect the rights of their citizens.</li>
                <li><strong>The U.S. Bill of Rights (1791)</strong> – The Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution, was created to guarantee individual freedoms like the right to free speech, the right to a fair trial, and protection from cruel and unusual punishment. These rights became fundamental to American democracy, ensuring that the government could not abuse its power over its citizens.</li>
                <li><strong>Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)</strong> – After the horrors of World War II and the Holocaust, the world saw the need to protect human rights on a global scale. In 1948, the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a document that set out fundamental rights for all people, no matter their nationality, ethnicity, or religion. These rights include the right to life, liberty, and security of person, and the right to education and work.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Historical Figures</h2>
            <p>Throughout history, many people have worked tirelessly to expand or protect the rights of others. Some of these individuals became symbols of their movements, inspiring others to join in the fight for justice and equality. Here are some of the most important figures who helped shape our understanding of rights and responsibilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Martin Luther King Jr.</strong> – Martin Luther King Jr. was a key leader of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States during the 1950s and 1960s. He believed in using peaceful protests and nonviolent resistance to fight for racial equality. His most famous speech, “I Have a Dream,” delivered during the 1963 March on Washington, called for an end to racism and discrimination. King’s leadership helped lead to significant changes, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.</li>
                <li><strong>Nelson Mandela</strong> – Nelson Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary who became the country’s first Black president in 1994. Mandela spent 27 years in prison for fighting against the system of apartheid, which legally separated Black South Africans from whites. After his release, Mandela worked to heal the divisions between the races and build a new, democratic South Africa. His courage and leadership showed the world the power of forgiveness and reconciliation in creating a society based on equality and justice.</li>
                <li><strong>Rosa Parks</strong> – Rosa Parks is known for her role in the Civil Rights Movement, particularly for her act of defiance in 1955. She was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white man on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Her act of resistance became a key event in the Civil Rights Movement, leading to the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a year-long protest against bus segregation. Parks’ courage inspired others to take a stand against racial injustice.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="movements">
            <h2>Major Movements</h2>
            <p>Throughout history, different movements have fought to secure or protect the rights of individuals and groups. These movements often challenged the established systems of power and sought to bring about social, legal, and political changes that would grant rights to those who had been denied them. Some of the most significant movements in history include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Women's Suffrage Movement</strong> – The fight for women's right to vote was a long and difficult struggle. Women in many countries had been denied the right to vote for centuries, but through decades of protests, speeches, and writing, they won the right to vote in the early 20th century. In the United States, leaders like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton were at the forefront of the suffrage movement. Their hard work paid off with the passage of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920, which granted women the right to vote.</li>
                <li><strong>The Civil Rights Movement (1950s–1960s)</strong> – The Civil Rights Movement in the United States was a struggle for racial equality, primarily focusing on ending segregation and discrimination against African Americans. Leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and Malcolm X fought for the rights of Black Americans through peaceful protests, legal challenges, and public demonstrations. The movement led to important legislative changes like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which banned discrimination in public places and ensured voting rights for all citizens, regardless of race.</li>
                <li><strong>The Abolitionist Movement</strong> – The fight to end slavery in the United States was one of the most significant rights movements in American history. Led by figures such as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and William Lloyd Garrison, the abolitionist movement sought to end the practice of slavery and grant freedom to millions of enslaved people. After years of activism, the passage of the 13th Amendment in 1865 officially abolished slavery in the United States, but the movement also set the stage for the ongoing fight for racial equality and civil rights.</li>
                <li><strong>American Revolution</strong> – The colonists' right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as outlined in the Declaration of Independence, alongside their responsibility to resist tyrannical government and actively participate in self-governance.</li1>
                <li><strong>Abolitionist Movement</strong> – The right to freedom from slavery, with the responsibility of individuals to actively support the Underground Railroad and advocate for abolition laws.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Rights and responsibilities are at the core of how societies function. The fight for rights—whether civil rights, women's rights, or the rights of marginalized groups—has shaped history and continues to influence the world today. As societies evolve, the idea of what constitutes a "right" changes, and new movements continue to push for justice and equality. Understanding the struggles of the past helps us ensure that the rights of all people are respected and protected in the future.</p>
            <p>The work of individuals and movements throughout history shows that change is possible, but it requires determination, courage, and the willingness to fight for what is right. As we continue to build a more just world, we must remember the lessons of history and the responsibilities we have to protect the rights of everyone.</p>        </section>
